My name is a NUMBER, no one knows how exact
Hated by many, my banning had no tact
When I was BAKED, they made me dead
No apple here, it was in a THREAD
Pi

Hated democratically, each vote was dear
Even with Admin’s support, the choice was clear
Suffice to say, the count was not NEAR
The Far Side

I constantly attacked, but not on the OFFENSIVE
You might have seen my massive missives
Partial to warcraft, but no white KNIGHT,
Disagree? You’re in for a fight!
Defender

4
You might say I was a CALAMITY
With extra schooling for notoriety
I’ll HIJACK your boat just for laughs
My Diagnoziz? You must be daft!
DrDizaster

In the future I’ll get a HANDLE
But for now, I’m split in shambles
So put up your FISTS! I’m rearing for fights
On hit! Big crits! P.S. that webcomic bites

I wanna be badass, like Snake in BOXES
So I’m liftin them ups!  You like that, hosses?
Near the ENDER, I get no respect
FYI the application? They double checked.

I’m broken in shambles but still breathing
FRESH as the day I was cooked up
But time HARDENS me revealing
Death comes lookin, I’ll fuck him up
Stale

8
I’m kinda new, don’t give me the COLD shoulder
Fixing these problems like Sisyphus’ boulder
You think that’ll break me? You ain’t slick
I’m made of IRON you son of a bitch
IcyLiquid

I made some nice POTPOURRI
For us to discuss what’s IMPORTANT TO ME
I ain’t talking bout Tolkien
The CARDINAL rule: I must be toke’n!

Strong as an ox? You got the wrong ANIMAL.
My nom deplume ain’t a MAMMAL.
If HEAVY LIFTING won’t fix what ails ya
For TWENTY BUCKS I might erase ya!

I make my money through ONOMONOPEIA!
I drink that shit up like fresh sangria
Is that enough to FILL YA?
Now quiet you’re interrupting my animes.

I’m NO WHALE, but I love me some hump-BACKS
VOLLEYBALL’s where I lay my hard smacks
But even when I can’t make it
I come home to my snuggly BLANKET

A tale as old as TIME? Psh, I would know.
That Beast ain’t shit, I’m the real beauty
I knew Noah biblically (no homo)
Now gimmie a clam to break on my tummy

I’m on your SIX like an AIRPLANE PILOT
I’m the FASTEST there is, best not try it
It’s not about the ending, it’s about the JOURNEY
Isn’t that nice? Wait til you get to know me!
Bogey

Don’t ask yes or nos, give me the THIRD OPTION
Think you see me? “Ran away” reads the caption
Now if you gonna front, you’re cruising for a BATTLE

I may be a LITTLE BOY, but it’s no time for bed.
Don’t check my temp! My face is not RED!
Time to whip out my artistic pedigree
Make you laugh so hard you lose colonic integrity.

I am unique like NO OTTER;
I may RIGHT the wrongs, but I’m no fighter;
I’m the face of Canadian coins, but I’ve never been;
No can someone tell me if Smash Bros. is a sin?;
Munkus Beaver

You know, I used to love celery
Til he made a thread how you all want to get with me
I wanted to ROCKET away and have some fun
Travel to the LEGEND or PLANET, 3rd rock from the sun
World as Myth

19
Like a FINE WINE, I get better with age
If you want a PICTURE, then take a page
From my book and have a meal
Don’t SCARF it down! It’s made from veal.

My name is something you’d find near toilets
But that’s nothing compared to the shit I deal with
For a brief stint, I tried adoption
But the kid I got turned out to be rotten

What do you call one mod yelling in a cave?

My favorite X-Man is GAMBIT
My favorite Metroid game is chronologically the last.
And half of me just wants to stab guys in prison!

Do I really have to STRIP for this job?

A beemer is nice, but I’d really like a…

His TECH was something to respect
But has long since ended the ride
VANILLA'S REIGN ended his pain
And he'll catch you on the FLIP SIDE

I sullied my JOKE'S HISTORY

But my spirit lives on in ev'ry DIGIMON
like a wandering, tormented ghost

I'll there when you talk
about ROMs or porn or joints
There's no ghost in this MACHINE
Just endless infraction points

I seem to be quite SERIOUS
But really I'm just mysterious
I'll give you some HELP, the answers not on yelp
So you'll just have to ASK one of us

My GENEROSITY is far beyond that of the common rube
Though that may be disputed by the one whom you call TUBE

Not a day goes by without a post from me
I am a CANINE, but have no fur
There's many COMICS for you to see
I am synthetic, but also a CUR

You've seen a STORM of my type
But never covering a single star
I'm WEATHER of a forum stripe
A pattern that you may find BIZARRE

My epic thread on WIZARDS 
was perfect and without taint 
These days I've given up posting 
to dabble in a bit of PAINT

I dabble in CARTOGRAPHY 
A virtual type of fun 
But when I finish doing that 
I trot off with my GUN

SPIRACLES are his passion 
Chelicerae another one 
To him CHITIN is a fashion 
Why should chordates have all the fun?

An ARCHIVIST and a HOST 
I kept the CHAOS stable 
for a very many post
