# Category Roles
This plug-in allows users to be granted the default category permissions of a role on a per-category basis.  For example, a user in the Member role might be given the default category permissions of the Moderator role, but only in the General Discussions category.

These additional permissions are assigned per-user and per-category.

_Please Note: Only a role's default category permissions are granted.  __A role's global and per-category permissions will not be granted by this plug-in.___
