Role Tracker
----

Highlight and tag posts made by users in selected roles.

- **Tag:**
 - In a discussion, tag(s) appears next to comments by a users that belongs to one or more tracked role(s).
 - Every time there is a new post in a discussion, tracked roles tags are added to that discussion. Those tags show up in the discussion list.
 - RoleTracker tags will take priority over user defined tag of the same name. ie: if you have a RoleTracker tag Moderator users won't be able to tag a discussion with a tag named Moderator.

- **Tagged list:** Every tracked discussion can be viewed using the `/discussions/tagged/[RELEVANT_TAG]` endpoint.
