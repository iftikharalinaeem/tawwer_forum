# Overview

## Purpose

Facilitate the capture of user access and usage data, interpret it and display the trends in a way that is helpful and easy for a user to understand.

## Features

1. Data collection via an analytics backend, currently keen.io.
2. Dashboard widget collection pages for "Traffic" and "Posting" data widgets.
3. Bookmarking widgets for a personalized analytics dashboard.
4. Rationing widgets by cloud plan level.
5. Toolbar for drilling down by date range, interval (monthly/daily/hourly), and meta data (e.g. category or role).

## Plan Levels

There is a config named `VanillaAnalytics.Level` to determine which widgets are available to a customer. The default is `basic` if this isn't set. Other valid values are, in order of ascendance: `corporate`, `enterprise`, & `vip`. All tiers are a superset of their widgets plus all the tiers below.

As of spring 2017, half of the widgets are available at `basic` (in code: `SMALL_WIDGET_RANK`) and all widgets are available at the `corporate` (`MEDIUM_WIDGET_RANK`) level. The `enterprise` and `vip` both evaluate to the same tier (`LARGE_WIDGET_RANK`) and have no widgets assigned yet.

# Glossary

1. **Page view**: Opening a single page / one click on a site.
1. **Visit**: Multiple page views and actions between periods of inactivity.
1. **Post**: A discussion or comment.
1. **User**: An individual signed in to their forum account.
1. **Active User**: A user who has visited & viewed posts (within the timeframe).
1. **Participant**: A user who has made a post (within the timeframe).
1. **Role Type**: Some roles are assigned default role types, including: Administrator, Moderator, Default, and others.


# Setup

You'll need to make sure your forum configuration has some values set before you enable the plug-in.  If you don't have them, you won't be able to track the data.

## Required settings

* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.OrgKey` Organization-level API key. *Required for keen.io project provisioning.*
* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.OrgID` Unique identifier for a keen.io organization. *Required for keen.io project provisioning.*
* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.DefaultProjectUser` E-mail address associated with a keen.io user having access to the configured organization. *Required for keen.io project provisioning.*
* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.ProjectID` Unique identifier for a keen.io project *Required for keen.io event tracking.*
* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.ReadKey` Scoped read API key for the configured project. *Required for keen.io charts and reporting.*
* `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.WriteKey` Scoped write key for the configured project. *Required for keen.io event tracking.*

If `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.ProjectID` is not set when the plug-in is enabled, it will attempt to automatically provision one.
This will only be possible with the project provisioning requirements cited above.
If `VanillaAnalytics.KeenIO.ProjectID` is set, no attempt will be made to create a new project and the project provisioning requirements are not necessary for the site.

## Optional settings

* `VanillaAnalytics.DisableTracking` Stops tracking all events.
* `VanillaAnalytics.DisableDashboard` Don't display links to access analytics data in Vanilla's dashboard.
* `VanillaAnalytics.Widget.*` Enable an analytics widget.  The last portion of the config should be one of the widget slugs.  Some widgets are included by default (e.g. Discussions, Comments, Page Views and all metrics).
* `Garden.Analytics.AllowLocal` Off by default. Allows localhost running.
* `Garden.Analytics.Enabled` On by default. If this is set to false, analytics will be blocked.

# Widgets

When reading widgets descriptions you can always add "during/for the selected time range" at the end of the sentence.
Widgets hide themselves if they have no data to show.

There are 3 types of widgets:
- **Metric**
  - Metrics are a single information quantifying something for the selected time range.
- **Leaderboard**
  - Leaderboards are tables showing the ranking of specific items for the selected time range.
  The "previous" rankings are calculated using the rankings of the previous time range.
- **Graph**
  - Graphs can come in multiple forms! They are always information fetched using the selected time range.
    - Line, Area, Bar: Use the selected interval to group the fetched information.
    - Pie chart: Represent multiple values for the whole selected time range.

# Notes

## Data collection mechanism

Pageviews rely on the `gdn.stats` JavaScript function being triggered and an [event listener](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla/pull/3503) being utilized by a service tracker's JavaScript.
`gdn.stats` is fired if `gdn.meta.AnalyticsTask` is set to `tick`.  This should happen by default, unless you're testing from a local environment.

**If testing locally**, you'll need to enable `Garden.Analytics.AllowLocal` in your config.  If you have `Garden.Analytics.Enabled` disabled in your config, this will also block `gdn.stats` from firing.
