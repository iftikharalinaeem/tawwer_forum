# Warnings & Notes

This plugin allows moderators to warn users and add private notes to profiles to help police the community. Moderators can warn users on both comments and discussions.

**Notes:**

This plugin does not support the assignment of multiple posts to a single warning. In this case, the warning is attached to the latest selected comment/discussion, but the URLs of each selected post are inserted into the body of the warning.

If posts with different authors are selected, the moderator is prompted to reselect posts with the user who will receive the warning.
