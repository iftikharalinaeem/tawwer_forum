# Analytics Dashboards

## Notes

- When a chart uses the word "by" it means "grouped by".
- Role Type is the roleType column. I'm guessing we'll rename that as far as chart titles go, but "Role Type" is fine for now.
- Any text within (brackets) is for the developer and should be ommitted from the chart title.
- A (M) also indicates that there should be a metric as well as a chart.

See the README for the `vanillaanalytics` plugin for a list of the widgets.
