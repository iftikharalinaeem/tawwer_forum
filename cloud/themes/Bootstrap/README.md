# Bootstrap 1 Theme

__This theme is deprecated__. Do _not_ start a new theme based off of this. Do _not_ apply this theme to any new client sites.

## Building Styles / Javascript / Images
This theme is built with the [Vanilla Cli](http://docs.vanillaforums.com/vanilla/vanilla-cli) and does not come with its own build toolchain. With that installed you can simply run:
```bash
vanilla build
```
or
```bash
vanilla build --watch
```
to build your styles/js/images. Documentation for the CLI can be found [here](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli).

Built styles and javascript should be checked into the repo along with source files.
